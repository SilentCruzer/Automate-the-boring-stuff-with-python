1. What is the function that creates Regex objects?

	re.compile()

2. Why are raw strings often used when creating Regex objects?

	backslashes do not have to be escaped.


3. What does the search() method return?

	It returns matched objects.

4. How do you get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object?

	By using group()

5. In the regex created from r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)', what does group 0 cover? Group 1? Group 2?

	group 0 - covers the entire match
	group 1 - covers the first set of parentheses
	group 2 - covers the second set of parentheses

6. Parentheses and periods have specific meanings in regular expression syntax. How would you specify that you want a regex to match actual parentheses and period characters?	

	Parentheses and periods can be escaped by using \ 
	\. , \( and \)	

7. The findall() method returns a list of strings or a list of tuples of strings. What makes it return one or the other?

	If regex has no groups, a list odf stirings is returned and when regex has groups it returns as list of tuples of strings.
8. What does the | character signify in regular expressions?

   	It signifies matching 'or' between groups


9. What two things does the ? character signify in regular expressions?

	Match zero or one of the preceding groups or to signify non greedy matching.

10. What is the difference between the + and * characters in regular expressions?

	+ - matches one or more
	* - matches zero or more

11. What is the difference between {3} and {3,5} in regular expressions?
	
	{3}   - matches exactly 3 instances of preceding group
	{3,5} - matches 3 to 5 instances of preceding group

12. What do the \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?

	\d - single digit
	\w - word
	\s - space

13. What do the \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?

	\D - not a digit
	\W - not a word
	\S - not a space

14. What is the difference between .* and .* ? ?
	
	.* - greedy matching
	.* ? - non-greedy matching

15. What is the character class syntax to match all numbers and lowercase letters?

	[0-9a-z]

16. How do you make a regular expression case-insensitive?

	using re.I as the second arugument in re.compile()

17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile()?

	. character matches any character except new line. If re.DOTALL is passed as second argument then . character match any character including newline.

18. If numRegex = re.compile(r'\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '12 drummers, 11 pipers, five rings, 3 hens') return?

	'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'

19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allow you to do?

	It helps to add space and comments to the stirings passed to re.compile()

20. How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits? It must match the following:

	'42'
	'1,234'
	'6,368,745'

	but not the following:

'12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)
'1234' (which lacks commas)
	
		re.compile(r'^\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*$' )

21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:

'Haruto Watanabe'
'Alice Watanabe'
'RoboCop Watanabe'
but not the following:

'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)
'Mr. Watanabe' (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)
'Watanabe' (which has no first name)
'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)


	re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\sWatanabe')


22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:

'Alice eats apples.'
'Bob pets cats.'
'Carol throws baseballs.'
'Alice throws Apples.'
'BOB EATS CATS.'
but not the following:

'RoboCop eats apples.'
'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'
'Carol eats 7 cats.'


 re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\.', re.IGNORECASE)
